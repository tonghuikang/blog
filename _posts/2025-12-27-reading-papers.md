I want to take the opportunity to share which papers I kept, and my thoughts on reading paper.

I have not written any real papers.

Authors want to get their work published.

You need to understand the motivation of the author

Academia is not that efficient. My estimate is that the industrial labs has more impact per unit spend. Of course, there are labs that create more impact than the others.

There is a parable where you visit a sensei, and your cup is full you cannot pour any more you need to empty your cup

Cite eugeneyan on something about learning.

Learning by doing?

You will be talking to chatbots and asking you what is new. It is like you are the prof and you have a graduate student that understands you well. People should publish their conversations with the paper.

Examples are important. I read the examples first before the abstract. Examples communicate taste the best.

What exactly the model did not say. Even papers contributing to the frontier of open source do not declare everything

Capture the author's intuitions.

Writing papers is performative. Reading papers is performative.

This is list not meant to be a list of papers which are better. It is just printouts that I decide to keep for now.

Good to review old papers to understand what people are thinking at that time.

I can't read without a pen.
