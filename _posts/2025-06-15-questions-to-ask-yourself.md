title: Questions to ask yourself
---

These are some questions to answer yourself to understand how yourself works. It might also be helpful when interacting, improving and redesigning AI.

I wrote this back in [February 2025](http://blog.huikang.dev/2025/01/27/ai-for-high-school-students.html), I am expanding on these questions.


## How do you respond?

Can all our responses be modeled as a next token prediction? What is a token? Are we all just next token predictors?

What do you actually respond with? It is just words that you speak? Are you aware of all your outputs?

What do you respond on? What exactly are the inputs? Are you aware of the inputs?


## How do you reason?

Why do you even reason? Why do you skip reasoning?

Is your reasoning correct, and did you arrive with an acceptable answer with a wrong reasoning?

Did you initially have an answer in mind? Is the reasoning merely a process to justify the initial answer, and would reasoning have changed your judgment in this case?

Are you aware of all your reasoning?

Who is the reasoning for?


## How do you evaluate what is good?

Given two responses, do you know which one is better?

Why is one better? If one is better, where in the response is it better?

You don't get feedback. How then do you determine what is good?

The feedback given is vague, or maybe even wrong. How then do you determine what is good?



## How do you learn?

What are you learning, what exactly is the content are you learning?

How do you behave differently before and after learning? Will you now respond differently given the same context? How about similar contexts?

Are there unintended consequences from learning something? Are you aware of these effects? How do you contain these effects?

How do you measure whether you have actually learned?



## What do you value?

How do you decide what to do?

What are you naturally curious about?

What do you find fun?

What result are you happy with?



## How do you lead?

How do you run an organization?

How would you hire? What are the characteristics of the people you want to hire?

How much awareness do you want over the actions of your hires? How much do you micromanage?

How do you assign rewards to your hires?
