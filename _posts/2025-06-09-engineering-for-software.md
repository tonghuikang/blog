title: Engineering for Software (TBC)
---

Software engineering will soon become an exercise to get AI to write software.

- If there is a mistake, think whether are you wrong or the AI is wrong.

- You should build tools that AI is easy to use. Start from the command line.

- Think of the blockers to AI productivity.

- If there is a reproducible bug, it is easy for AI to solve.

- The bottleneck will be communication. The bottleneck between humans has always be communication.

- The more guardrails you give, the faster the AI can work. The more you restrict the model what the model can or cannot do, the more you trust it to not do the wrong things.

- Better unit tests.

- Better documentation in the code.

- Single source of truth.

- Build the knowledge graph so that AI can traverse.

- Educate your colleagues on how to use AI. Maybe in the commit message should include how simple the instruction is. Get people to learn the capabilities.

- Avoid investing effort where it will be overturned by better AI models. One frustrating thing is that the image models are blind and they report success when they should not. (Comment on what to do, what not to do)

- Your role is to build processes and oversee results. Hence Engineering for Software.

- You should connect your AI to data sources.

- Stop tolerating suboptimal interfaces. Tools that return responses with verification. Products that forces you to go through a lot of information before getting anything useful.

- You should use AI products where the product builder is aligned with your incentives.

- Make it very obvious when the AI is cheating. If the AI need to write a special case cover up an error, the special case can be surfaced. Get other AI to catch cheating.

- Optimize how much you want to read. Guide AI to communicate effectively. Commit messages should be short.

- You no longer implement a button on the website. Sure you still decide to implement a button. You may be getting AI to implement the button. You now need to think of how to get AI to implement. You will improve the processes on getting AI to implement. You will unblock AI to implement.

- Start with simple tasks. Delegate verifiable tasks first.




## Get into the mindset of delegating

- Think of AI as a very competent remote contract software engineer. The engineer in the company you respect the most, but from another company.

- Think of what you are working on. Think whether is it something that you can done by the remote contract software engineer.

- You need to feel that - I should not be doing this, this could have been done by someone else.

- You need to build your own desire to delegate. When you are asked to implement a button, your first reaction should be - this is something that could have been done by an AI.




## Provide AI access to all the context available

- This does not mean copying your entire company history to the context length. You are tasked with implementing a button. Provide AI all the context. You should not need act as the translator for AI. Invest in building connections.

- You should provide AI with access to these data. I think the model these days (Claude 4 Sonnet) is able to figure how what to search.

- Give the example of implementing a button.



## Implement guardrails for AI

- It is easier to leave AI to do whatever they want if you know the very few things AI has access to.

- In theory, AI can take over your browser and function as an remote employee. In reality we are not there yet, although we will soon be there.

- Continue with the example of implementing a button.



## Invest in processes

You are the factory manager, not a factor worker.

- You should invest now. Tools that make it easier for AI also make it easier for humans. Some investments might not be worth it might be worth it now. (Give an example.)

- Continue with the example of implementing a button.



## Propagate good use of AI

- In code review, comment on how your commit would have been done with AI, and discuss what is blocking AI from doing it.

- Continue with the example of implementing a button.
