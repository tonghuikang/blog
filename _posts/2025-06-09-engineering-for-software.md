title: Engineering for Software
---

Software engineering will soon become an exercise to get AI to write software.

- If there is a mistake, think whether are you wrong or the AI is wrong.

- You should build tools that AI is easy to use. Start from the command line.

- Think of the blockers to AI productivity.

- If there is a reproducible bug, it is easy for AI to solve.

- The bottleneck will be communication. The bottleneck between humans has always be communication.

- The more guardrails you give, the faster the AI can work. The more you restrict the model what the model can or cannot do, the more you trust it to not do the wrong things.

- You should invest now. Tools that make it easier for AI also make it easier for humans. Some investments might not be worth it might be worth it now. (Give an example.)

- Better unit tests.

- Better documentation in the code.

- Single source of truth.

- Build the knowledge graph so that AI can traverse.

- Educate your colleagues on how to use AI. Maybe in the commit message should include how simple the instruction is. Get people to learn the capabilities.

- Avoid investing effort where it will be overturned by better AI models. One frustrating thing is that the image models are blind and they report success when they should not. (Comment on what to do, what not to do)

- Your role is to build processes and oversee results. Hence Engineering for Software.

- You should connect your AI to data sources.

- Stop tolerating suboptimal interfaces. Tools that return responses with verification. Products that forces you to go through a lot of information before getting anything useful.

- You should use AI products where the product builder is aligned with your incentives.

- Make it very obvious when the AI is cheating. If the AI need to write a special case cover up an error, the special case can be surfaced.

- Optimize how much you want to read. Guide AI to communicate effectively. Commit messages should be short.

- In code review, comment on how your commit would have been done with AI, and discuss what is blocking AI from doing it.
