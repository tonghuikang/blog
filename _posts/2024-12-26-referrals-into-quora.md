Thank you for finding this post. I hope to share what I would like to see before I refer someone to Quora.

I do not think I would have received an interview opportunity with Quora based on my resume alone. I happened to get lucky in a programming contest held by Quora.

I hope to extend the opportunity to candidates, especially without the most well-known organizations or institutions in their resume.


## What is the purpose of referrals

My company has set up a referral process to find people who are a good fit for Quora. Statistics show that employees hired through referrals have longer retention and better performance.

This is how employee referrals has helped

- Help to get candidates to consider roles at Quora, who otherwise would not have considered roles at Quora.
- Help to identify candidates of great fit who otherwise won't be identified by recruiters.
- Help to provide additional context to referred candidates so that they know what they are signing up for.

In other words, the purpose of the referral process is to serve the company. I serve the company.

This is what I need to fill up when I file a referral

## Why do I usually decline to give referrals

Referrals are most effective when I have personally worked with the person I am going to refer.

Referrals are also effective when someone I closely work with (one of the closest 3~4 people that I work with in one of the years) refers someone that they closely work with.

If you are asking for referrals out of the cold, it does not belong to the above two categories.

Referrals are also effective when you don't need the referral. In this case, I am still willing the give a referral so that I can serve to provide an alternative point of view. Of course, my observations may still be reported to the hiring manager.

I decline to give a referral when I could not easily identify something that recruiters might not be able to appreciate. You are still free to apply through the typical application process.


## What to include in your reach-out

I need to identify something which I think recruiters might not be able to easily appreciate.

Please include your resume and share at least one of the following. Note that you do not need to do ALL of these, you just need ONE.

- A demo that I can try out, with the url that I can access
- Github [profile]() with a [repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/automatic-prompt-engineer) you think represents your work
- Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/huikang) and a useful [resource](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/konwinski-prize/discussion/553294) that you have shared
- Knowledge-related social media profile on one of these platforms - [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tong-Hui-Kang-1), YouTube, TikTok, Zhihu, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. Share a piece of content that you have [published](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-reinforcement-fine-tuning-was-implemented/answer/Tong-Hui-Kang-1) that you think is great
- [Poe](https://poe.com/huikang) profile with non-trivial bots (specify which [one](https://poe.com/ChineseStatement))


## What to write when reaching out

I offer the following template.


>I would like a referral for the role Senior Full Stack Software Engineer - Core Product, Poe (Remote).
>
>I have made (demo) which you access in (url).



## Where to reach out to me

When you cold message me, I appreciate a LinkedIn message or Quora private message (if they happen to be enabled).

On LinkedIn, as of writing, it seems that [free members](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/175xw5v/5_free_personalized_invitations_per_month/) can send up to 5 invites per month with at most 200 characters each.

Thanks for reading, and all the best!
