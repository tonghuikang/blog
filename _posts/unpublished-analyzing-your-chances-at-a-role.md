title: Analyzing your chances at a role
---
I write some advice on how to analyze your chances at landing a specific role at a company.


I do not think I should saying outright to people that you are not fit for a role.
I don't think I want to easily give out assessment of your chances at getting an interview, especially for a role for a company that I am currently employed in.



## Find out who was recently hired for the role

What was their previous company.

Did they attend the top schools.

You need to do you own research. I think it is quite hard to do this research by yourself.

What is their visa situation.

What is their level they are hired at

What do you is their backstory



## Read the requirements

When the role asks for someone how is experienced in the field, it meant what is meant.



## Ask people
