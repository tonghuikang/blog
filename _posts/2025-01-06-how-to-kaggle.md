I write about things to ask yourself when doing Kaggle


  These is the list and I will elaborate on this
- What about yourself that you want to prove?
- What is the competition actually about? What is the game? 
- What do you think other people is doing wrongly?  
- What do you think people are doing wrong?
- What things useful to the community do you want to share?
- What is the level of abstraction that you want to work on?
- What is the point of your work? Does you work has real world applications?
