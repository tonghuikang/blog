title: How to Kaggle
---
I write about things to ask yourself when doing Kaggle


These is the list and I will elaborate on this

# What about yourself that you want to prove?

If you already know how to code, you don't need to prove that you know how to code.


# What is the competition actually about?

Do you understand.

You might be tricked by leaderboard scores.



# What do you think other people is doing wrongly?

Is there something that you think everyone is doing wrongly?

What do you think everyone else has missed?

What do you think the community is wasting time on?


# What things useful to the community do you want to share?


# What is the level of abstraction that you want to work on?




# What is the point of your work? Does you work has real world applications?  


There are questions and statements from people that they show that they do not know anything. I think it is rude to tell them they are totally on a wrong track (if you don't have anything useful don't say).

Software engineering skills

Discussion guide
- read the room
- provide useful information
- actually sign off your posts

Personally not opposed to the use of AI, but it has to be useful


# Competitions

- 
- Generally you may not need to do well in competitions.
- A notebook that helps people works better.

I feel that some competitions are lame and do not advance science.


# Datasets

- To be honest. 
- I think only original datasets should be credited.
- Kaggle is not the best place to train anything using GPUs. You should pay for your own GPUs elsewhere.


# Notebooks

- Please credit the source ideas well. You should credit them at the start of the notebook.
- You should fork notebook instead of downloading and uploading a notebook. This makes it easier to track what you have changed from the source notebook.


# Discussions

- I downvote . I usually only downvote them when they interrupt my post.
- Use of sockpuppets. Upvotes are public. We know.

- Not reading the room. If my content is about prompt engineering please don't hijack my post and talk about fine-tuning.
- Taking more space than necessary.
