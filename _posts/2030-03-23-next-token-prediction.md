title: Steady state products in AI
---
When I was in undergrad I was informed - (cite Ilya's video) - if you can predict the next token, you understand.

Next token prediction could be a lot of things. Jason Wei's slides?

When you write the first token you already somewhat planned what to do at the end.

Some tokens are easier than the others

Everything can be formulated as next token prediction (as long as the output is next)

Diffusion?
Image generation?
Voice?

Large concept models?

At this point it is somewhat of a ___
"Everything follow the law of Physics"
"God has a plan for everything"
If it doesn't you just redefine your task


You can train a model to predict the next prime number of a large prime number, but this does not mean you should.
You should still train the model to either use tools to calculate, or use reasoning to calculate by hand.
