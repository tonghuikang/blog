To whom it may concern

I would like to work on frontier AI models and products at your company.

Currently I work on Quora's recommendation systems. I also spend my time at work building AI integrations - notably getting CLAUDE.md to work and Claude Code hooks, and unlocking AI access to more than just code and unit testing.

Things I have built - ARC-AGI-2 code dataset, ARC-AGI-2 finetuning attempt, 
Smaller projects - electoral boundaries, participated with Meta AI Hackercup, 
Some writeups - GRPO (pending), principles for AI product, TBC

These are some things I hope to build
- Competitive programming supercommunity
- Multichannel models

Of course, I am happy to start out in any relevant position that work.

Linked copy is available on cover.huikang.dev.

I have worked on AI experiments during my free time. I hope to work on AI full time as well.

Thank you for reading.

Hui Kang
