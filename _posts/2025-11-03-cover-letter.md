To whom it may concern

I would like to work on frontier AI models and products at your company.

I work at Quora, currently integrating AI tools like Claude Code while working on the recommendation system. I write and maintain the CLAUDE.md and hooks of Quora monorepo. I built the agentic query over Quora data lake and content.

I have been an ardent user of LLMs and I have good intuition on where LLM responses are bad and how to improve them.

Things I have built - ARC-AGI-2 code dataset, ARC-AGI-2 finetuning attempt
Smaller projects - electoral boundaries, participated with Meta AI Hackercup 2024
Some writeups - GRPO (pending), principles for AI product
I still do LeetCode for fun.

These are some things I hope to build
- Multichannel models
- Prompt decaching
- Competitive programming supercommunity

Of course, I am happy to start out in any relevant position that works.

Linked copy is available on cover.huikang.dev.

I have worked on AI experiments during my free time. I hope to work on AI full time as well.

Thank you for reading.

Hui Kang
