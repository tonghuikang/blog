To whom it may concern

I would like to work on frontier AI models and products at your company.

I work at Quora, currently integrating AI tools like Claude Code while working on the recommendation system. I write and maintain the CLAUDE.md and hooks of Quora monorepo. I built the agentic query over Quora datalake and content.

I have been an ardent user of LLMs and I have good intuition on where LLM responses are bad and how to improve them.

Projects - ARC-AGI-2 [finetuning](https://todo.huikang.dev) attempt with [generated](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025/discussion/613470) [code](https://arc.huikang.dev) dataset, Claude Code [template](https://github.com/tonghuikang/claude-code-template), Meta Hacker Cup [2024](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup/2024/final-round/scoreboard?track=AI_CLOSED_TRACK) AI track [participation](https://github.com/tonghuikang/meta-ai-hackercup-2024), electoral [boundaries](https://github.com/tonghuikang/electoral-boundaries), [automated](https://github.com/tonghuikang/automatic-prompt-engineer) prompt engineering
Some writeups - GRPO (pending), [principles](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/09/07/principles-for-ai-products.html) for AI products, delivering [instructions](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/10/20/delivering-ai-instructions.html) to AI models, [prompting](https://blog.huikang.dev/2024/12/31/prompting-projects.html) projects, competitive programming [supercommunity](https://blog.huikang.dev/2024/12/29/competitive-programming-and-superintelligence.html), life [lessons](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/08/23/reinforcement-learning-life-lessons.html) from reinforcement learning, [questions](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/06/15/questions-to-ask-yourself.html) to ask yourself, 

I still do LeetCode for fun.

These are some things I hope to build
- Multichannel models
- Prompt decaching
- Competitive programming supercommunity

Of course, I am happy to start out in any relevant position that works.

I am currently on the H-1B visa. I am a Singapore citizen eligible for USA H-1B1 work authorization [without lottery](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b1), unaffected by the [100k fee](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1236782038492934) imposed on H-1B visas. 
I am currently based on South Bay and I am keen to relocate. 
I am eager to start working as soon as the visa process allows.

A linked copy of this text is also available on cover.huikang.dev.

I have worked on AI experiments during my free time. I hope to work on AI full time as well.

Thank you for reading.
