title: Feedback for Claude Code June 2025
---

Lack of parallelism
- I want to write the commit when the code is running
- (Cite by multichannel proposal)

Claude Code is still single part

MCP is a mystery to use
- Hello World by reading the weather? IDK
- Maybe each tool should be a local MCP with a demonstration that we can follow

Should not use Bash tools
