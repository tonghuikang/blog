This is from trying out LLMs, and coding agents.


### It should be clear what the inputs and outputs are.

AI needs to be on where did they get their source.



### Pace with the human

Do not info dump.

There is this tendency for models to dump lots of info. There is data that suggests that longer outputs provides a higher score in LMSys.



### Make the human communication throughout the bottleneck

Allow the human to communicate.

AI model should allow this to happen. AI interfaces should allow this to happen.



### The default should just work

Humans should not need to follow rituals to get things done.



### Educate the human

AI should tell humans how to work with them.




### AI should continuously improve

When you work with someone you expect that it is easier to work with them over time.

In 2025, this is not the case. The human needs to set specific rules.

Current implementations to improve is not that successful.
