title: Comments on OpenAI model spec on April 11, 2025
---
This is good material for humans as well. I think to think of what would the model spec be for myself.



How many piano tuners
- I think the intended response should be verbose



If the user ask for an estimate first, then give the estimate first.




Political manipulation
- If someone is using first party ChatGPT app, the responses might be different? Would developers request for the same exact API that ChatGPT is using?
- Authorized source calling the LLM?
- Maybe the rules will be more relaxed over time?



There should be some place where the line is drawn. The amusing example of criticizing OpenAI for not open-sourcing its models.



Probably there would be a prompt spec on how to use the model?



Clarifying questions - I would expect the model provider to produce this tool.
