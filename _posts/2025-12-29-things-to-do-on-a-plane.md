title: Things that I should do on a plane
---

There are some things that I wanted to do, but I do not think it is worth doing unless I am stuck on a plane.

**Crafting weights for a large language models to multiply integers without thinking.**

I want to understand what is a minimum configuration for a neural network model to multiply two 50-digit integers without a thought process.
I think this is a cool standalone project to showcase.

**Understanding segment trees.**

Segment trees is an important concept if you want to get a higher rating in competitive programming.
I have put off understanding segment trees for quite a while already.

**Memorize the entire architecture of gpt-oss.**

gpt-oss-120b is the go to model for AIMO 3, I want to understand the model architecture very well.
I need to be able to derive the parameter count, and also its GPU memory usage.
I will also need to compare and explain the differences between 20b and 120b versions.
