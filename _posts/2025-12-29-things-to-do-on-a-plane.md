title: Things that I should do on a plane
---

There are some things that I wanted to do, but I do not think it is worth doing unless I am stuck on a plane.

**Crafting LLM weights to multiply integers without thinking.**

It is already expected that frontier models have perfect performance at multiplication without tool use. 
Frontier models should be able multiply step-by-step, only limited by time and space complexity.

However, I am interested in multiplication without a thought process, the model is expected to reply with the product directly.

I want to try crafting weights to perform multiplication perfectly. I will also need to study the multiplication algorithm itself.

There is this related work on [training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05217) a model to perform modular addition perfectly.

**Understanding [segment trees](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html).**

Segment trees are an important concept if you want to get a higher rating in competitive programming.
I have a [template](https://github.com/tonghuikang/codecomp/blob/3f93809d7577a544e05eb56754370c9a68f6fc4c/template/template_segment_trees.py) that I do not know how to use.
I think I also need to understand the algorithm and the intuition behind segment trees.

**Understanding [Aho–Corasick algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm).**

LeetCode contests tested this two times.
- [Construct String with Minimum Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-with-minimum-cost/) in [Weekly Contest 405](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-405/)
- [Minimum Number of Valid Strings to Form Target II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-ii/) in [Weekly Contest 415](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-415/)

I solved both problems with other methods.

**Tree matching problem with wildcards**

You have two rooted trees.
Some nodes are wildcards.

The task is to determine whether you can assign each wildcard a subtree so that you can match the two trees.

Please do not ask me where I got this problem.

**Memorize the entire architecture of [gpt-oss](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b).**

gpt-oss-120b is the go-to model for [AIMO 3](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-3). I want to understand the model architecture very well.
I need to be able to derive the parameter count, and also its GPU memory usage.
I will also need to compare and explain the differences between 20b and 120b versions.

**Watch some films**

These are the films I have yet to watch
- Zootopia 2
- Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle
- Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc (only watched the first half)
- Ne Zha 2
- KPop Demon Hunters
- Neon Genesis Evangelion
