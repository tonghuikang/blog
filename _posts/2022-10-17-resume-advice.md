I have been giving comments on technical resumes in Discord channels by the Tech Interview Handbook and cscareers.dev.


# Use Jake's Resume Overleaf Template

Generally, if there is a glaring formatting error, I would not even comment on the text you wrote.

Some time ago I advised someone that formatting, grammar and spelling is like body language.
Body language is very important in communication.
I do not trust that you know the technology if you cannot even detect suspicious capitalization and nomenclature.
If you cannot even follow the style of the template, I do not think you can follow the style of our codebase either. 

These are the common glaring formatting errors

- Inconsistent indentation
- Inconsistent line spacing
- Inconsistent date formats
- Inconsistent use of separators (e.g. between company and job title)
- Inconsistent chronological order
- Inconsistent font size
- Inconsistent use of emphasis (underline, bold)
- Excessive use of emphasis
- Wrong use of capitalization for technical terminologies
- Incorrect usage of whitespace within the text (e.g. space before full stop)
- Excessive space

You can easily check and fix these mistakes if you use a template.
I recommend using [Jake's Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).
You need to be able to figure out how to use LaTeX, and even make edits to the template.
If you could not figure out how to use LaTeX, I do not think you think you can figure out how to use our tools.


Borderline formatting annoyances

- Make sure every bullet point of yours looks full. Your bullet points should not end with one word on the next line. Aim to have the last line of the bullet point occupy at least 60% of the line. You might need to summarize or elaborate on your bullet points to achieve this.
- Do not hyperlink entire sentences, especially with underline, bold and blue font. You might still want to make the hyperlink known it is a hyperlink. I recommended having [Github | Demo] or [link] at the end of the line to direct interested readers.
- Inconsistent spaces between words. I understand there is a tradeoff between aligning the end of line by justifying text, and having consistent space between words. I would choose the latter. The latter is also not that visible if you are using a one-column resume template.
- Use of italics and underlining. (This is my opinion, I understand that Jake's resume uses italics.) Italics and underlining emphasize the words by making them hard to read. I do not like text that is hard to read. I would only use bold for emphasis and headers.

You can fix these formatting issues easily.


# Use Google XYZ formula

Where are you studying, where did you intern, are facts that cannot be changed. Formatting is just something you should not fault on.

What you can optimize is how you describe your projects and experience with bullet points.
Between candidates of similar backgrounds, a better-written set of bullet points will decide who will get the interview.

The best advice on how to write your bullet point is Google's [XYZ formula](https://youtu.be/S_Macvy5CQE?t=83).

> Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z

I would like to elaborate on this advice further

- "Accomplished" is a power verb. Bullet points should start with a power verb. Also, avoid having two power verbs that are the same in your resume. You can refer to a list of power verbs [here](https://www.faangtechleads.com/resume/general-guidelines).
- The statement is modular. You can just read the first part (i.e. Accomplished X) or the first two parts (Accomplished X, as measured by Y) and get something out of it. If you reverse the order, you will delay your actual accomplishments to the end, and the reader may not get your point.
- I notice that "measured by Y" is placed before "by doing Z". It reflects that the results and their measurements are more important than whatever fancy methods you used to achieve your accomplishments.
- Metrics are important in tech companies. Startups secure funding with their metrics. Established tech companies make decisions on products and promotions with their metrics. You should try to shape your work so that it has an impact and it is measureable. If none of your work made it into production and there is no business metric to speak of, you might want to estimate the number of hours saved with that you "derisked", or describe the features you "experimented" or "prototyped".


This post describes the pattern of how I have been commenting on your resumes. I hope it helps!
