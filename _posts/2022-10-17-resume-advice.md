I have been giving comments on technical resumes in Discord channels by the Tech Interview Handbook and cscareers.dev.

I would summarize the objective of your resume with the following
- The first objective of the resume is to give the reader a reason to even read your resume. Recruiters have a lot of resumes to read. If your resume is badly formatted, the recruiter would simply skip your resume.
- The next objective of your resume is to show that you are worth interviewing. Interviewing takes up precious engineering time from engineers. You want to show that you are someone that has a good chance of receiving an offer.
- The final objective of your resume is for behavioral interviews. The hiring manager usually would go through your resume in detail with you. You want your resume to support the process.



# Ensure your formatting is faultless

Common formatting errors

- Inconsistent indentation
- Inconsistent line spacing
- Inconsistent date formats
- Inconsistent use of separators (e.g. between company and job title)
- Inconsistent chronological order
- Inconsistent font size
- Inconsistent use of emphasis (underline, bold)
- Excessive use of emphasis
- Wrong use of capitalization for technical terminologies
- Incorrect usage of whitespace within text (e.g. space before full stop)

You can easily check these mistakes if you use a template. Generally, if there is a glaring formatting error, I would not comment on the contents of the resume.

Some time ago I advised someone that formatting, grammar and spelling is like body language. Body language is very important in communication. I do not trust that you know the technology if you cannot even detect suspicious capitalization and nomenclature. If you cannot even follow the style of the template, I do not think you can follow the style of our codebase either. 


Borderline formatting annoyances

- Make sure every bullet point of yours looks full. Your bullet points should not end with one word on the next line. Aim to have the last line of the bullet point occupy at least 60% of the line. You might need to summarize and elaborate on your bullet points to achieve this.
- Inconsistent spaces between words. I understand there is a tradeoff between aligning the end of line by justifying text, and having consistent space between words. I would choose the latter. The latter is also not that visible if you are using a one-column resume.
- Use of italics and underline. (This is my opinion, I understand that Jake's resume uses italics.) Italics and underlining emphasize the words by making them hard to read. I do not like text that is hard to read. I would only use bold for emphasis and headers.

You can fix these formatting issues easily.



# Optimize your bullet points

Where are you studying, where did you interned at, are facts that cannot be changed. Formatting is just something you should not fault on.

What you can optimize is how your describe your projects and experience with bullet points. Between candidates of similar backgrounds, a better-written set of bullet points will decide who will get the interview.

The best advice on how to write your bullet point is Google's [XYZ formula](https://youtu.be/S_Macvy5CQE?t=83).

> Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z

I would like to analyze this advice further

- The statement is modular. You can just read the first part (i.e. Accomplished X) or the first two parts (Accomplished X, as measured by Y) and get something out of it. If you reverse the order, you will delay your actual accomplishments to the end, and the reader may not get your point.
- I notice that "measured by Y" is placed before "by doing Z". It reflects that results are more important than whatever fancy methods you used to achieve your accomplishments.
- Accomplished is a "power" verb. Bullet points should start with a power verb. Also, avoid having two power verbs that are the same in your resume. You can refer to a list of power verbs [here](https://www.faangtechleads.com/resume/general-guidelines).


This post describes the pattern of how I have been commenting on your resumes. I hope it helps!
