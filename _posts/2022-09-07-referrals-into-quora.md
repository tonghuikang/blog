I do not think I would have received an interview opportunity with Quora based on my resume alone. I happened to get lucky.

I hope to extend the opportunity to candidates who do not have experience in the most well-known organizations or institutions.

When I write a referral, I aim to point out salient details of your application to the hiring manager. You do not need everything that I have listed here. I hope you can direct me to these resources so that I can find and evaluate them.

Technical proficiency is important and I hope to see it.
- GitHub profile, with a repository or a pull request that represents your work. I want to get a sense of how you organize your code. If your project happens to have a significant impact, that is great.
- Kaggle profile, with a notebook or a discussion post that represents your work. I want to see how you communicate your ideas and interact with other contributors. I want to see whether are good at finding impactful work and executing it.

Quora's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge. Your experience in creating content helps us with our mission. Please include If you have significant content created on one of these platforms
- Quora, YouTube, TikTok, Zhihu, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram

When you cold message me, I appreciate a contact through LinkedIn or Quora private message.

All the best for your applications.
