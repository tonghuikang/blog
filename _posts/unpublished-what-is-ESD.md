I am finishing my studies in Singapore University of Technology and Design under the pillar "Engineering Systems and Design". I still struggle to explain what exactly my pillar offers.

It is easy to understand what other pillars in SUTD does

- Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) - architecture
- Engineering Product Development (EPD) - build physical stuff
- Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) - build computer stuff
- Design and Artificial Intelligence (DAI) (new pillar) - build stuff with a focus on AI

The pillar I am in is Engineering Systems and Design (ESD).

## Pillar descriptions

We first look at some description of the ESD pillar.

This is the description from the [school website](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/) by the Head of Pillar Peter Jackson.

> Engineering Systems and Design deals broadly with large-scale systems and the design, the planning and the management of these systems.

This is how I introduce myself and my course of study in my technical interviews.

> I am a final year student from Singapore, studying at Singapore University of Technology and Design. In my course, Engineering Systems and Design, we use math and code to model company processes to analyse and optimise them. I participate in coding competitions, on Codeforces I am a candidate master, on Kaggle I am a notebooks expert.

In a recent dialogue with the ESD Head of Pillar Peter Jackson, I ask him how would he introduce ESD in a job interview. This is his response.

> Collecting together the engineering disciplines that deal with systems, that is the core of ESD. In other universities, these areas are split into different domains: Management, Industrial management, Chemical engineering, etc. Here in ESD we pull together the core elements in these domains from these multiple domains and put them together, blending data science, decision science, finance and economics, logistics and process optimization. This is what ESD is about.

## Courses

This is the list of core courses all ESD students will need to take

- Optimisation. We study the Simplex algorithm to solve linear optimisation problems, algorithms to solve the network flow problems. We also understand some concepts on dynamic programming and integer programming. Optimisation is about maximising or minimising an objective subject to the constraints, and in this course, the objective and constraints are linear.
- Data and Business Analytics. One half of the course teaches basic finance and accounting concepts, and the other half of the course teaches basic data analysis tools. The school would usually source projects from companies for students in assigned groups to do.
- Probability and Statistics. I took these courses in SMU instead of SUTD, I could not comment on how this course is conducted in SUTD.
- Manufacturing and Service Operations. Manufacturing involves managing inventory level, and the question is how much inventory to manage and how much inventory should you refill, and this courses explores the optimal solutions given the assumptions. Service involves queues, and we understand the performance of a modelled queue. The group project requires us to work on a manufacturing operations or service operations problem from a company that we need to find.
- Engineering Systems Architecture. We were also taught some tools for model our solution as states and subsystems, and well as some concepts of multi-objective optimization. The project requires us to use these decision tools to build a game.
- Simulation, Modelling and Analysis. We were taught tools to design simulations, and use statistics to estimate the performance of the simulations. The group project requires build a simulation and analyse the findings.

The following are electives that ESD students can take. With a sufficient combination of courses, the track can be recognised in the transcript.

- Supply Chain - Supply Chain Management and Supply Chain Digitalisation and Design
- Business Analytics and Operations Research - Statistical Machine Learning, Advanced Optimisation and Stochastic Modelling, Networked Life, Game Theory
- Finance - Investment Science, Equity Valuation and Financial Systems Design
- Aviation - Airport Systems Planning and Design, Airport System Modelling and Simulation



## Outcomes of ESD concepts

Business degrees, like the one I did in SMU, has half of the courses being more quantitative (math and formulas) and half of the courses qualitative (concepts and frameworks). Usually quantitative courses have projects that are more quantitative in nature, and therefore the content is more like two-thirds quantitative, one-third qualitative.

ESD can be viewed as a business degree from the perspective of engineering - which is more than 90% quantitative. We do have our dose of qualitative courses from Humanities courses that we need to take each term.

ESD and business degrees provides us methods to help us to make better decisions. The quantitative decisions needs to be backed with data and assumptions.

These are some outcomes of concepts from ESD.

- Explanation. Given that something has happened, how we explain what this has happened?
- Prediction. Given past data and current information, what is the prediction.
- Prescription. Given the scenario, what actions do we recommend?
- Policy. How should we set up a system such that we can maximise the benefits from the parties.
