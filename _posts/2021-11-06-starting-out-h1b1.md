title: "Starting out as an H-1B1 holder"
---

In summary, this is my US immigration background

- I have never been to the US prior.
- I do not have any relatives in the US.
- I am a Singapore citizen, who is eligible for H-1B1. Unlike H-1B, no lottery process is needed to apply for a H-1B1.
- I am starting my role as a software engineer at Quora in November 2021.

Pieces of information here may be useful to you. Much of the information here is expected to be short-lived. Some information, such as the list of items needed, may be incomplete. Some information, especially if I have not gone through the process, like getting a driving license, may be inaccurate.



## Getting a Job Offer

You need to get a job offer and accept the job offer first, before getting a visa.

I got a Quora interview from a public coding competition organised by Quora back in [February 2021](https://challenge.quora.com/).

The company would hire immigration lawyers to help you with their required paperwork. You need also need to do a substantial share of paperwork. You should not be paying any adminstrative fees except to the US government.



## Obtaining a H-1B1

Ashley has written [a very comprehensive guide](https://ashleylim.medium.com/navigating-the-h1b1-visa-process-4c8e459c4b96) on the process of obtain a H-1B1

There are a few things from the article I want to highlight
- Schedule your interview appointment early. With Covid and all, the availability of the timeslot can be inconsistent. Once you are confirmed that you are accepting the offer, you can complete the DS-160 early and schedule an interview timeslot. The risk of rescheduling it early is that you might lose the deposit. I could reschedule the interview twice. 
- I paid my MRV application fee with SAM. However, I learnt that this option has since been [unavailable](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/sg/sg-niv-paymentinfo.asp).



Your company lawyer would prepare an application package for you. Fragomen is my company immigration lawyer. For mine, it includes

- Form G-28, Notice of Appearance of Attorney
- Certified Form ETA-9035, Approved Labor Condition Application
- Employer support letter
- Copy of applicant's passport biographic page
- Evidence of applicant's educational qualifications (some evaluator saying that my degree is legitimate)
- Corporate documents (basically public information about Quora)



This is my timeline regarding my H-1B1 visa

- Confirmation of offer (April)
- Scheduled an embassy interview date (August)
- Commencement to get graduation scroll (25 September)
- Labor Condition Application Certified (1 October)
- Hardcopy Visa application documents shipped (5 October)
- Hardcopy Visa application documents received (8 October)
- Embassy interview (13 October, 0915)
- Pickup passport with H1B1 visa (14 October)
- Preflight Covid ART Testing (30 October)
- Flight the US (2 November 1840)
- Commence job (8 November)



## Flight and Preflight Covid testing

I took Singapore Airlines direct flight from Changi Airport to San Francisco International Airport. My premium economy airfare was \$1109.30. I remember seeing options for a round trip at \$1300, but I did not bother with that.

You cannot do an online check-in on Singapore Airlines with the H-1B1 visa. Apparently, the option is for people who do not need a visa to travel to the US, or are on the [Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html). I needed to check in physically. This was not indicated in the user interface and gave me a small panic.

The premium economy seat allows for 2 bags of 23 kg each. I tried to check in 3 bags of 10 kg each and was rejected, but we did prepare for the scenario. 

As per [US Covid regulations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html), I needed to take a Covid test. An ART test works for entry into the United States, and I paid $30 for the test. The results of the ART test is produced within less than half an hour. PCR tests are more expensive, and the results is usually only produced the next day. You are recommended to take a test that is able to print your passport number along with it. The Singapore Airlines website lists [some testing locations](https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/pdt-pcr-locations/).

You should [research](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) on what you cannot bring to the US. You cannot bring most foods. My luggage was probably flagged because I brought a frying pan in that interrupted with the scanning. I got my passport locked in a transparent locker, which was unlocked after they are opened. 



## Housing

I did not source for housing. My housemates were the ones who chose the house. The house is quite far from my office, but I do not mind because Quora is remote-first.

You can find the housing offers on [craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/) or Zillow.

If you do not have any contacts here, you can first Airbnb for a temporary place of residence and then find a place to rent for the long term.

I will write more when I complete the whole house-hunting process.



## Bank account

You need a bank account to receive your payroll, and to make payments from. Many services do not accept international debit/credit cards - I had to use my friend's US credit card for ordering items from Walmart, AT&T or T-Mobile. The only service I managed to use an international debit card for is Uber.

My friend recommended me Chase Bank. You may ask someone to refer you so that they also get their referral bonus on your first payroll.

The only decision I have to make when opening an account is whether I want to open a savings account. There are restrictions how often can you withdraw from a savings account (because it is meant for savings).

If you do not overdraft, the maximum fees incurred is probably \$12 per month from the checking account and \$5 per month from the savings account.

I had the following to open my bank account

- Original Passport
- A proof of residence - a rental agreement with your name, or your company HR confirming that you live in that address, or a utility bill.
  - Apparently, my housemates managed to use the J1 visa as proof of residence.
  - I drafted an email for HR to sign and forwarded it to the banker.

## Social Security Number

The I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form requires a social security number.

I called the [Redwood City](https://ssofficelocation.com/offices/california/redwood-city/redwood-city-social-security-office-94063/) social security office on 4 November 2021 for an appointment on 19 November 2021. I would need to bring my passport with the machine-readable H-1B1 visa and I-94.

There is a [procedure](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnvisa/) for you to apply for your Social Security Number when you apply for your immigrant visa, but I have not heard of anyone doing it. 

If you are in the US for internship or exchange, you might want to get a US bank account and a social security number, which makes it easier when you are back here to work.



## Phone Number and Mobile Data

My peers strongly recommend Mint Mobile. The prices are much cheaper. However, Mint Mobile requires a [compatible phone](https://www.mintmobile.com/byop/). I should have bought an iPhone when I was in Singapore before moving to the US.

My phone was incompatible, so I have to settle with using ATT. I have shipped (you need an address and you need to wait for the shipment) a SIM card and will be getting a [3-month $99 prepaid plan](https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1391956/).

In Singapore, you could simply buy a prepaid SIM card from any phone store, and I have been surviving on that till today. I would have preferred to do this here as well.

In my first days in the US, when outside of any free WiFi range, I have been using my Starhub prepaid data roaming. I still need a local phone number urgently so that I can receive my 2FA from the bank.

I will move on to Mint Mobile after buying an iPhone.



## Driving

I do not have a driving license in Singapore. You need to know how to drive to get anywhere in the US. Public transport is very rudimentary.

It is easier to learn how to drive in the US than in Singapore. To learn driving you first need to pass a theory test, then you may drive in the presence of a fully licensed driver. After passing the practical test, you have the full license. The process in Singapore is more complicated.

However, if you have already learnt how to drive in Singapore, it would be much easier to start out here, just by passing local driving tests.

You may want to get a second-hand car for a few thousand dollars. You need to buy car insurance as well.



## Support Group

My Singaporean friends have helped me settle in and lent me some USD. I sought advice from my Singaporean friends for much of the content above. You can express appreciation to your friends by signing up for their referrals (Chase and Robinhood for example).

As a fresh graduate, a support group is important. You share knowledge and information with each other and grow together. If your company is mostly remote, you need to create these interactions.

Do not let any of these stop you from pursuing your career in the US. I think there are some good reasons that might make you reconsider moving to the US - for example, you could not get a job offer, you have your significant other in Singapore, or your parents are living their last days.



I hope these will help.
