# Starting out as an H-1B1 holder

In summary, this is my US immigration background

- I have never been to the US prior.
- I do not have any relatives in the US.
- I am starting my role as a software engineer at Quora in November 2021.

Pieces of information here may be useful to you. Many of the information here may be short-lived. Some information, such as the list of items needed, may be incomplete.



#### Getting a Job Offer

You need to get a job offer and accept the job offer first, before getting a visa.

I got a Quora interview from a public coding competition organised by Quora back in [Feburary 2021](https://challenge.quora.com/).

Of course, please make sure that it is a legitimate company. You should not need to pay any agency other than the US government.

The company would hire immigration lawyers to help you with their required paperwork. You need also need to do a substantial share of paperwork.




#### Obtaining a H-1B1

Ashley has written [a very comprehensive guide](https://ashleylim.medium.com/navigating-the-h1b1-visa-process-4c8e459c4b96) on the process of obtain a H-1B1

There are a few things from the article I want to highlight
- Schedule your interview appointment early. With Covid and all, the available timeslot, with Covid and all, the availability of the timeslot can be inconsistent. Once you are confirmed that you are accepting the offer, you can complete the DS-160 early and schedule an interview timeslot. I have rescheduled the interview twice.
- I paid my MRV application fee with SAM. However, I learnt that this option has since been [unavailable](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/sg/sg-niv-paymentinfo.asp).



Your company lawyer would prepare an application package for you. Fragomen is my company immigration lawyer. For mine, it includes

- Form G-28, Notice of Appearance of Attorney
- Certified Form ETA-9035, Approved Labor Condition Application
- Employer support letter
- Copy of applicant's passport biographic page
- Evidence of applicant's educational qualifications (some evaluator saying that my degree is legitimate)
- Corporate documents (basically public information about Quora)



This is my timeline regarding my H-1B1 visa

- Confirmation of offer (April)
- Scheduled embassy interview time (August)
- Commencement to get graduation scroll (25 September)
- Hardcopy Visa application documents shipped (5 October)
- Hardcopy Visa application documents received (8 October)
- Embassy interview (13 October, 0915) 
- Pickup passport with H1B1 visa (14 October)
- Preflight Covid ART Testing (30 October)
- Flight the US (2 November 1840)
- Commence job (8 November)



#### Flight and Preflight Covid testing

I took Singapore Airlines direct flight from Changi Airport to San Francisco International Airport. My airfare was \$1,109.30. I remember seeing options for a round trip at \$1300, but I did not bother with that.

The premium economy seat allows for 2 bags of 23 kg each. I tried to check in 3 bags of 10 kg each and was rejected, but we did prepare for the scenario. 

As per [US Covid regulations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html), I needed to take a Covid test. An ART test works for entry into the United States, and I paid $30 for the test. The results of the ART test is produced within less than half an hour. PCR tests are more expensive, and the results is usually only produced the next day. You are recommended to take a test that is able to print your passport number along with it. The Singapore Airlines website lists [some testing locations](https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/pdt-pcr-locations/).

You should [research](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) on what you cannot bring to the US. You cannot bring most foods. My luggage was probably flagged because I brought a frying pan in that interrupted with the scanning. I got my passport locked in a transparent locker, which was unlocked after they are opened. 



#### Housing

I did not source for housing. My housemates were the ones who chose the house. The house is quite far from my office, but I do not mind because Quora is remote-first.

You can find the housing offers on [craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/) or Zillow.

If you do not have any contacts here, you can first Airbnb for a temporary place of residence and then find a place to rent for the long term.




#### Bank account

You need a bank account to receive your payroll.

My friend recommended me Chase Bank. You may ask someone to refer you so that they also get their referral bonus on your first payroll.

The only option that I have to make when opening an account is on whether to open a savings account. There are restrictions how often can you withdraw from a savings account (because it is meant for savings).

If you do not overdraft, the maximum fees incurred is probably \$12 per month from the checking account and \$5 per month from the savings account.

I had the following to open my bank account

- Original Passport
- A proof of residence - a rental agreement with your name, or your company HR confirming that you live in that address, or a utility bill. I drafted an email for HR to sign. Apparently, my housemates managed to use the J1 visa as proof of residence.
- The coupon for a \$225 [signup bonus](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/landing). If the link is shared by your friend, your friend gets [\$50](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/landing).



#### Social Security Number

The I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification requires a social security number.

I called the [Redwood City](https://ssofficelocation.com/offices/california/redwood-city/redwood-city-social-security-office-94063/) social security office on 4 November 2021 for an appointment on 19 November 2021. I would need to bring my passport with the machine-readable H-1B1 visa and I-94.

There is a [procedure](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnvisa/) for you to apply for your Social Security Number when you apply for your immigrant visa, but I have not heard of anyone doing it. 

If you have been to the US before for internship or exchange, you might already have a US bank account and a social security number, which makes it easier when you are back here to work.



#### Phone Number and Mobile Data

My peers strongly recommend Mint Mobile. The prices are much cheaper. However, Mint Mobile requires a [compatible phone](https://www.mintmobile.com/byop/). I should have bought an iPhone when I was in Singapore before moving to the US.

My phone was incompatible, so I have to settle with using ATT. I have shipped (you need an address and you need to wait for the shipment) a SIM card and will be getting a [3-month $99 prepaid plan](https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1391956/).

In Singapore, you could simply buy a prepaid SIM card from any store, and I have been surviving on that till today. In my first days, when outside of any WiFi range, I have been using my Starhub prepaid data roaming. However, I need a local phone number so that I can receive my 2FA from the bank.

I will move on to Mint Mobile after buying an iPhone.



#### Driving

I do not have a driving license in Singapore. You need to know how to drive to get anywhere in the US. Public transport is very rudimentary.

It is easier to learn how to drive in the US than in Singapore. To learn driving you first need to pass a theory test, then you may drive in the presence of a fully licensed driver. After passing the practical test, you have the full license.

You may want to get a second-hand car for a few thousand dollars. You need to buy car insurance as well.



#### Support Group

If you work at Facebook as a Singaporean, you will have a pretty strong support group. Elsewhere, you need to find your friends.

My Singaporean friends have helped me settle in and lent me some USD. I sought advice from my Singaporean friends for much of the content above.

As a fresh graduate, a support group is important. You get to share knowledge and information with each other on how to become a better professional and grow together. If your company is mostly remote, you need to create these interactions.

Do not let any of these stop you from pursuing your career in the US. I think there are some good reasons that might make you reconsider moving to the US - for example, you have your significant other in Singapore, or your parents are living their last days.
