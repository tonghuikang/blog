title: Who are you actually building for
---
You should think who are you actually building for, and what that could actually mean.

## Build for yourself

You build for yourself. You build what you want. You build what you will use. You remove that you do not use.
However, you don’t represent the user. There may not be enough users like you to fund your product.


## Build for your resume

You build features that do not make sense. There are no benefits for the user. It just looks complex. This is resume-driven development. Somehow your plan is approved. One such feature is finetuning models where prompt engineering would suffice.


## Build for VC funding

AI features that don’t make sense, strategy that does not make sense, flashy announcements that don’t get realized.


## Build for board members

You want to follow the latest industry buzzwords so the executive looks good to the people who keep them in power. The board needs to be entertained with quarterly updates so that the executive can justify their continued employement.
It does not matter if you get ridiculed in public 


## Build for the current users

You just look at A/B test and see if the numbers goes up. If it goes up, good. If the does not go up, bad. You might not might need to understand why and how.
These changes could lack taste, because you do not believe your taste matches with the average current users.
You no longer build what you want to use


## Build for the intended users

You have some users. But they are users that you do not want. You want a different set of users.
Character AI and roleplay


## Build for the power users

Maybe they have outsized influence in the community. But they do not represent your current users or your intended users. Their recommendations could be infeasible, and add lots of complexity.


## Build for the decision maker

Because you don’t want to get fired, you don’t want to argue. You follow whatever decisions that has been made, and the procedures so that it works in the company


## Summary

There is no right answer who should you be building for. But you should be aware who are you actually building for. Maybe you are guided by genuine improvement in the product, or maybe by professional pride, or your own conscience. Maybe you are guided by self-preservation. In any case, awareness is good.
