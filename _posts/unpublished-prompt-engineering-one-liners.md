title: Prompt Engineering One-liners
---
I share some one-liners on prompt engineering.

There might repeated content from my other posts, but of many of them could not be put in a logical order in other posts.

Just use string filters lol

I can give some explanation if requested.

- Your job a prompt engineer is not to write prompt but to build a system that measure how bad your prompts are
- Prompt are temporary, evals are forever (from someone)
- TBC
