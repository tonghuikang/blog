title: How to prepare for AI as a high school student

TODO: add context


## Prompt (from the teacher)

Some questions they have offhand:
- What is the daily life of a SWE / AI / ML engineer like?
- What kinds of challenges do you face?

I think you might probably end up having to prompt them somewhat, though I can act as moderator to do that on your behalf. Some things I suspect they will probably have more to ask about once they learn more:

- How do you think AI agents & assistants will change the nature of the job in the next few years?
- Could you briefly outline the AI / ML industry, and what opportunities you see for Singapore students / undergraduates / tech workers?
- What skills should we work on to be noticed and get into <industry / company>?





## Background

- Anderson Secondary School (3+2)
- Anderson Junior College (PCME)
- Singapore University of Design (ESD, DDP)
- Machine Learning Engineer at Quora




## What do I actually do

Generally
- Plan changes
- Make changes
- Prove that the change is good
- Improve processes to do the above

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms




## Challenges at work

Generally
- Determining what is worth working on
- Measuring success rigorously
- Communicating to an appropriate level of detail
- Investigating what went wrong

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms




## Example project - Follow-up questions

Given an answer, write a follow-up question for the writers on Quora to answer

Breaking down this problem
- Should we even write follow-up questions to the answer
- How to write good questions
- How do we show the questions to the writer
- When the answer is written, how do we better distribute the answer
- How do we measure success




## How to get noticed

Denys - https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7287635346698211328/

Sample from the list of students who graduated from your course
- https://www.sutd.edu.sg/campus-life/student-life/student-awards/honours-list/all/
- Search them on LinkedIn
- Reverse engineer on what they did to get there
- Talk to them





## Predictions on AI

In the near term (two years)
- If you can call a generic human expert to do, AI can do it too equally well
- If you can verify the task is done correctly, AI can do it much better than humans




## AI can do all low-context tasks

(TODO: better examples that could be more easily understood)

Low-context / no-context tasks
- Competitive programming
- Prompt engineering on a well-defined dataset

High-context tasks
- Providing the dataset for prompt engineering
- Planning what to do to improve Quora recommendation systems

Implications
- Companies have experimented with offshoring
- OpenAI operator
- AI will soon be doing all the work that is easy to explain
- If it takes more effort to explain and check than to do it myself




## AI will be superhuman at all verifiable tasks

(TODO: better examples that could be more easily understood)

Examples of easily verifiable tasks (short feedback loop)
- Competitive programming
- A-level math

Examples of tasks not easily verifiable (long feedback loop)
- A-level GP essay
- Writing marketing copies

Implications
- OpenAI o1 / o3
- The job here is to make the unverifiable verifiable




## Plotting this out

(TODO: better examples that could be more easily understood)

|                  | Easily verifiable                                       | Not easily verifiable                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low context**  | Competitive programming                                 | Describing Quora recommendation systems given the code |
| **High context** | Implementing experiment on Quora recommendation systems | Planning changes to Quora recommendation system        |




## Progression of AI

| Problem | Answer  | Method  | Example   | Ability                               |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Known   | Known   | Known   | ChatGPT   | Write code that looks like code       |
| Known   | Known   | Unknown | o1        | Apply methods to solve a problem      |
| Known   | Unknown | -       | AlphaZero | Invent new methods to solve a problem |
| Unknown | -       | -       | -         | Invent interesting problems           |

We have achieved superhuman performance in Go (game).
Competitive programming will be the first scientific discipline that AI will achieve superintelligence (in 1.5 years).
Then more will follow. Tasks that are low context and are easily verifiable will be solved earlier.




## What I think will take some time

(TODO: better examples that could be more easily understood)

These should take more than four years
- Humanoid robotics
- Managing and using long-term memory well
- Mind-reading (emotion recognition would need to happen first)

Ultimately, if there is another human that can do my work, AI can do my work.
There is no law in physics or theoretical computer science against this.




## What you can do to prepare

Understand yourself, understand other humans, understand AI

Improve yourself, improve other humans, improve AI

Questions to ask yourself
- How do you respond?
- How do you reason?
- How do you know what is good?
- How do you learn?
- What do you value?
- How do you lead?



## Q&A

- ML / AI roles
- How will AI change the world
