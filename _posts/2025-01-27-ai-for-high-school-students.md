title: How to prepare for AI as a high school student
---
I am making a presentation to some some students of Nanyang Junior College computing class. These are the notes.




## Background

- Anderson Secondary School (3+2)
- Anderson Junior College (PCME)
- Singapore University of Design (ESD, DDP)
- Machine Learning Engineer at Quora




## What do I actually do at work

Generally
- Plan changes
- Make changes
- Prove that the change is good
- Improve processes to do the above

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms




## Challenges at work

Generally
- Determining what is worth working on
- Measuring success rigorously
- Communicating to an appropriate level of detail
- Investigating what went wrong

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms

## Example project

Given an answer, write follow-up questions for the authors to write more answers

Breaking down this problem
- Should we even write follow-up questions to the answer
- How to write great (?) questions
- How do we show the questions to the writer
- When the answer is written, how do we better distribute the answer
- How do we measure success

Why is this fun
- The world gets useful knowledge that would likely not have been written
- This is being done at scale
- I get to put food on my table

## Advice on starting out

Build a project, deploy it to prod
- "I have given this advice to many people no one has done it so far" - [Denys Linkov](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7287635346698211328/)

Sample from the list of students who graduated from your course
- [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/honour/deans/), [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing/news-events/news/dean's-list), [SMU](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/undergraduate/beyond/students), [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/campus-life/student-life/student-awards/honours-list/all/), [SIT](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/provosts-list)
- Research them on LinkedIn
- Reverse engineer on what they did to get there
- Reach out to them if appropriate
- The exercise here is to understand what it takes
- (Do you need to be in NUS CS + NOC with internships every summer and semester?)




## Reflecting on my journey

What has happened to help

- Finding doing LeetCode (and solving problems) intrinsically fun
- Reaching out for opportunities (none of my internships is handed to me on a platter)
- Pure luck (Quora Programming Contest)

What could have helped more

- Getting to know someone who has been there
- Better taste on what projects are worth doing
- Better execution and deliver outcomes for projects
- Peers that motivate each other

## Predictions on AI

In the near term (two years)
- If you can call a generic human expert to do, AI can do it too, equally well
- If you can verify the task is done correctly, AI can do it much better than humans




## AI can do all low-context tasks equally well

Low-context / no-context tasks
- Competitive programming
- Writing an A-level General Paper essay

High-context tasks
- Implementing a button on the Quora website
- Planning how to improve Quora recommendation systems

Implications
- Companies have already experimented with offshoring
- OpenAI operator
- AI will soon be doing all the work that is easy to explain and check
- If it takes more effort to get others to do I will still rather do it myself

## AI will be superhuman at all verifiable tasks

Examples of easily verifiable tasks (short feedback loop)
- Competitive programming
- Implementing a button on the Quora website

Examples of tasks not easily verifiable (long feedback loop)
- Writing an A-level General Paper essay
- Planning how to improve Quora recommendation systems

Implications
- We have been classifying people with examinations and interviews
- OpenAI o1
- AI will soon be doing all the work that can be easily verified
- There is still plenty of human work to do to verify the unverifiable

## Plotting this out

|                  | Easily verifiable                          | Not easily verifiable                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low context**  | Competitive programming                    | Writing an A-level General Paper essay               |
| **High context** | Implementing a button on the Quora website | Planning how to improve Quora recommendation systems |




## Progression of AI

| Problem | Answer  | Method  | Example   | Ability                                    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Known   | Known   | Known   | ChatGPT   | Write code that looks like code            |
| Known   | Known   | Unknown | o1        | Apply methods to solve a problem           |
| Known   | Unknown | -       | AlphaZero | Invent new methods to solve a problem      |
| Unknown | -       | -       | -         | Invent interesting problems and solve them |

- We have achieved superhuman performance in Go (game) with AlphaZero
- Competitive programming will be the first scientific discipline that AI will achieve superintelligence from scratch (in 1.5 years)
- Then more will follow - tasks that are low context and are easily verifiable will be solved earlier

## What I think will take some time

These should take more than four years
- Humanoid robotics (the physical world is noisy)
- Managing and using long-term memory well (to become an actual employee)
- Mind-reading (emotion recognition would need to happen first)

Ultimately, if there is another human that can do my work, AI can do my work.
There is no law in physics or theoretical computer science against this.




## What you can do to prepare

Understand yourself, understand other humans, understand AI

Improve yourself, improve other humans, improve AI

Questions to ask yourself
- How do you respond?
- How do you reason?
- How do you know what is good?
- How do you learn?
- What do you value?
- How do you lead?
