title: How to prepare for AI as a high school student
---
I am making a presentation to some some students and teachers of Nanyang Junior College in Singapore. These are the notes.



## Objective

- My background as an ML engineer
- General career advice
- What is the current state of AI
- What is probably the next state of AI
- How can you prepare for AI



## Background

- Anderson Secondary School (3+2)
- Anderson Junior College (PCME)
- Singapore University of Design (ESD, DDP)
- Machine Learning Engineer at Quora




## What do I actually do at work

Generally
- Plan changes
- Make changes
- Prove that the change is good
- Improve processes to do the above

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms




## Challenges at work

Generally
- Determining what is worth working on
- Measuring success rigorously
- Investigating what went wrong
- Communicating to an appropriate level of detail

Just that it is related to machine learning algorithms

## Example project

Given an answer, write follow-up [questions](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-challenging-localization-problem-you-faced-in-the-Scooby-Doo-game/log) for the authors to write more answers

Breaking down this problem
- Should we even write follow-up questions to the answer
- How to write great (?) questions
- How do we show the questions to the writer
- When the answer is written, how do we better distribute the answer
- How do we measure success

Why is this fun
- The world gets useful knowledge that would likely not have been written
- This is being done at scale
- I get to put food on my table

## Advice on starting out

Build a project, deploy it to prod
- "I have given this advice to many people no one has done it so far" - [Denys Linkov](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7287635346698211328/)

Sample from the list of students who graduated from your course
- [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/honour/deans/), [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing/news-events/news/dean's-list), [SMU](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/undergraduate/beyond/students), [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/campus-life/student-life/student-awards/honours-list/all/), [SIT](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/provosts-list)
- Research them on LinkedIn
- Reverse engineer on what they did to get there
- Reach out to them if appropriate
- The exercise here is to understand what it takes
- (Do you need to be in NUS CS + NOC with internships every summer and semester?)




## Reflecting on my journey

What has happened to help

- Finding doing LeetCode (and solving problems) intrinsically fun
- Reaching out for opportunities (none of my internships is handed to me on a platter)
- Pure luck (Quora Programming Contest)

What could have helped more

- Getting to know someone who has been there
- Better taste on what projects are worth doing
- Better execution and deliver outcomes for projects
- Peers that motivate each other

## The state of AI

In the near term (two years)
- If you can call a generic human expert to do, AI can do it too, equally well
- If you can verify the task is done correctly, AI can do it much better than humans




## AI can do all low-context tasks equally well

Low-context / no-context tasks (easy to describe)
- Doing A-level math calculations
- Writing an A-level General Paper essay
- Competitive programming

High-context tasks (difficult to describe)
- Implementing a button on the Quora website
- Planning how to improve Quora recommendation systems

Implications
- Companies have already experimented with offshoring
- OpenAI operator
- AI will soon be doing all the work that is easy to explain and check
- If it takes more effort to get others to do I will still rather do it myself

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden">

</div>


## AI will be superhuman at all verifiable tasks

Examples of easily verifiable tasks (easy to grade)
- Doing A-level math calculations
- Competitive programming
- Implementing a button on the Quora website

Examples of tasks not easily verifiable (difficult to grade)
- Writing an A-level General Paper essay
- Planning how to improve Quora recommendation systems

Implications
- We have been classifying people with examinations and interviews
- OpenAI o1
- AI will soon be doing all the work that can be easily verified
- There is still plenty of human work to do to grade the unverifiable

## Plotting this out

|                                             | Easily verifiable<br>(easy to grade)                     | Not easily verifiable<br>(difficult to grade) |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Low context<br>(easy to describe)<br>**   | A-level math calculations<br><br>Competitive programming | Writing an A-level General Paper essay        |
| **High context<br>(difficult to describe)** | Implementing a button on the Quora website               | Improve Quora recommendation systems          |



## The current state of AI

|                                             | Easily verifiable<br>(easy to grade)                                               | Not easily verifiable<br>(difficult to grade)                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low context<br>(easy to describe)<br>**   | Better than the average professional, soon to be solved at a superhuman level      | AI can provide an acceptable response, but you can do it much better. You need to think of how to grade AI responses |
| **High context<br>(difficult to describe)** | You rather do this yourself, or break it down into tasks that are easy to describe | You need to make it easy to describe and verify for AI to be useful                                                  |




## Progression of AI

| Problem | Answer  | Method  | Example   | Ability                               |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Known   | Known   | Known   | ChatGPT   | Write code that looks like code       |
| Known   | Known   | Unknown | o1        | Apply methods to solve a problem      |
| Known   | Unknown | -       | AlphaZero | Invent new methods to solve a problem |
| Unknown | -       | -       | -         | Invent and solve interesting problems |

- We have already achieved superhuman performance in Go (game) with AlphaZero
- Competitive programming will be the first scientific discipline that AI will achieve superintelligence from scratch (my estimation is mid-2026), solving all problems that have not been invented
- Then more will follow - tasks that are low context and are easily verifiable will be solved earlier, at a superhuman level

## What I think will take some time

These should take more than four years
- Autonomous self-improvement (solving less verifiable low context tasks) 
- Managing and using long-term memory well (solving high-context tasks)
- Robotics (experiments in the real world is slow and expensive)
- Mind-reading (probably AI will need to get better at emotion recognition first)

Ultimately, if there is another human that can do my work, AI can do my work.
There is no law in physics or theoretical computer science against this.




## What you can do to prepare

Understand yourself, understand other humans, understand AI

Employ yourself, employ other humans, employ AI

Improve yourself, improve other humans, improve AI

Questions to ask yourself
- How do you respond?
- How do you reason?
- How do you know what is good?
- How do you learn?
- What do you value?
- How do you influence?
