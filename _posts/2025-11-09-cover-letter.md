To whom it may concern:

I would like to work on frontier AI models and products at your company.

I design, implement and test changes for Quora feed and digest recommendations.
I know the system end-to-end enough that I can investigate any issue with the recommendation system.
I run the ML systems design interview for recommendation systems and AI engineering.

I am the main maintainer for [CLAUDE.md](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/05/31/writing-claude-md.html) and [hooks](https://github.com/tonghuikang/claude-code-template/) for the company monorepo.
I developed the internal agentic query over the data lake to answer any data questions.
I invented some coding interview problems that are AI-resistant for now.
I still do LeetCode for [fun](https://leetcode.cn/u/tonghuikang/).

I built the process to generate questions on [recent events](https://www.quora.com/topic/Recent-Events).
I wrote prompts to label topics on content, and created the pipeline to backfill new [topics](https://www.quora.com/topic/DeepSeek-V3-AI-model).


**I would like to highlight my [personal project](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/11/04/arc-agi-2-attempt.html) to fine-tune LLMs to solve ARC-AGI-2.** My approach is to craft [golden solutions](https://arc.huikang.dev/) and guide [reinforcement learning](https://traces.huikang.dev/) with a modified version of [GRPO](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/10/28/group-relative-policy-optimization.html).

I believe I have good taste in [AI products](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/09/07/principles-for-ai-products.html), especially on how AI responses should [be](https://compare.huikang.dev/). I write about prompt engineering [projects](https://blog.huikang.dev/2024/12/31/prompting-projects.html), instruction [delivery](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/10/20/delivering-ai-instructions.html), and reinforcement [learning](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/08/23/reinforcement-learning-life-lessons.html). I have also experimented with automated [prompting](https://autoprompt.huikang.dev/html_output/prompt-history-classification.html), [animating](https://tonghuikang.github.io/flash-attention-animation/) flash [attention](https://www.quora.com/How-does-flash-attention-work/answer/Tong-Hui-Kang-1), and [AI](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup/2024/final-round/scoreboard?track=AI_CLOSED_TRACK) [competitive](https://github.com/tonghuikang/meta-ai-hackercup-2024) [programming](https://github.com/tonghuikang/meta-ai-hackercup-2025).

I also write about things I believe will be built - prompt [decaching](https://github.com/tonghuikang/blog/blob/main/_posts/2030-01-15-prompt-decaching.md), [multichannel](https://blog.huikang.dev/2025/05/14/multichannel-prediction.html) models, competitive programming [supercommunity](https://blog.huikang.dev/2024/12/29/competitive-programming-and-superintelligence.html). I hope to help build any of these. Of course, I am happy to start out in any relevant position to prove my value.


I am currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am happy to relocate to the City. I am currently on an H-1B visa. I am a Singapore citizen eligible for USA H-1B1 work authorization [without lottery](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b1), unaffected by the [100k fee](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1236782038492934) imposed on H-1B visas. I am eager to start working as soon as the visa process allows.

A hyperlinked copy of this text is also available on [cover.huikang.dev](https://cover.huikang.dev).

I have worked on AI experiments during my free time. I hope to work on AI full-time as well.

Thank you for reading.
