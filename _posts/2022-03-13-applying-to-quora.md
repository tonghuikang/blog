title: "Applying to Quora"
---

Here I post advice on applying to Quora, assisted with some public information.

Firstly, I want to share some background about myself.
- I have been [using and writing](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tong-Hui-Kang-1) on Quora, though most of my activity was during my time as a conscript in the Singapore Army.
- In January 2021, I participated in [Quora Programming Challenge](https://challenge2021.quora.com/) and was ranked 48th place in the second session, which got me an interview.
- I received an offer from the interview and have started my role as a New Grad Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
- You can refer to my outdated resume [here](https://blog.huikang.dev/resume/) and my internship lookbacks [here](https://blog.huikang.dev/2021/05/14/internship-reflections.html). I have documented my immigration process to the US [here](https://blog.huikang.dev/2021/11/06/starting-out-h1b1.html).

Here I answer some of the frequently asked questions.

I am sharing this in a personal capacity, I do not represent Quora here. Some of the comments may be relevant regardless of where you are applying to for a software engineering role.



## Preparations

How do I prepare for the Quora online assessments or programming interviews?
- I do not have materials that help you excel at Quora's interviews. For technical interviews in general, I will compile my favorite resources sometime in the future, but here is a short list.
    - For algorithms and data structure preparation, I would recommend mastering [the list of questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions) compiled by Yangshun.
    - For ML interviews, I recommend preparing to explain an ML project you have done, and why did you make certain decisions. The project could come from coursework. If you are asked to give your views on designing ML systems, [this](http://patrickhalina.com/posts/ml-systems-design-interview-guide/) and [this](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml) is a good start.
    - I am not familiar with the interview format for the other domains (data science, front end, back end infra). [Front End Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/) and [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) seem to have some good content.
    - For behavioral interviews, do refer to the prep doc that will be given to you. Be prepared to reply to the topics raised in the prep doc.
- Quora engineers shared in the Harvard CS50 course on how to prepare and practice for technical interviews [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIi-tIrcaww), [2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJjg2MkYPaY) and [2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pTVXaqJKU). More than half of the speakers are still working at Quora. I watched a bit of the Q&A, I think the content is still relevant and might give a perspective closer to Quora's.



How do I prepare my resume for my application for Quora?
- I would advice that you use a template like [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs), [this](https://resumake.io/) or [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz). This is the dominant advice on cscareers.dev Discord.
- Please check your resume for consistent formatting and correct spelling. Capitalization of the technology gives me a stronger impression about how much you know about the technology than the description that it follows. Attention to detail is something we look for in a software engineer.
- Where you studied and worked at are facts that you cannot change. However, you might want to frame your work so that it is easy for the reader to understand and appreciate what you have been doing.
- If you are a Singapore citizen, do [indicate](https://luyangkenneth.github.io/evolution-of-resumes/) that you are "eligible for the H-1B1 Singapore visa, which has a separate quota from the limited H-1B pool" in your resume, cover letter (if you have one), and "additional information you'd like to share" in the application form on Greenhouse. You will still be considered to "require sponsorship for employment visa status".



### Hiring

How high is the hiring bar for Quora?
- You can also search for employees from Quora on LinkedIn who started their roles right after graduation. This should give you a good gauge.


Does Quora accept first-year students as interns?
- I do not think we have been offering any high school graduates or first-year undergraduates for Quora internships unless you are a [IOI medallist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjohnny/) or [Alexandr Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrwang/).


Is it unlikely for a candidate from a Singapore university to work for Quora from the US?
- Singapore citizens have access to H-1B1 visas, which is from a quota that has never been filled. The immigration process is quite straightforward - no balloting is involved. (However, I would like to note that the visa is not guaranteed, although I have not heard of someone who is denied H-1B1 despite being eligible.)
- However, there is still an immigration process, unlike US citizens and recent graduates of US universities. Moreover, I think the company will also need to show that they have tried hiring skilled US citizens for the role. Therefore, I think your chances at a Quora interview are almost as good as a US citizen or someone who studied in the US. This does not mean that it is easy to get an interview either, the hiring bar is still quite high even for US citizens.


How many internship and new grad offers do you give out per year?
- I do not know the exact numbers, I think refer to cscareers.dev [process tracking](https://www.cscareers.dev/process-tracking), where users report their progress in Quora's hiring pipeline. I do not guarantee the accuracy of the information. You can also check back when someone reports their progress.


What is the salary range offered by Quora?
- I do not know the exact numbers, I think you can search [cscareers.dev](https://www.cscareers.dev/process-tracking) Discord channels or [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Quora/salaries/Software-Engineer/) for some reasonable estimate. I do not guarantee the accuracy of the information.



### Working at Quora

What is the difference between a machine learning engineer and a data scientist at Quora?
- Managers at Quora have [answered this question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-machine-learning-engineer-and-a-data-scientist-at-Quora). Here I offer a summarised answer. Data scientists are product analysts - they answer questions with product data. Machine learning engineers build, maintain, and improve machine learning systems. We use these machine learning systems for recommending stories and classifying content.


What is great about working at Quora?
- I would prefer to work on improving that something that I am using, and I want to know Quora's thought process and engineering effort.
- At this stage of my career, I prioritize learning, and Quora is a great place to learn. I have been learning how Quora's recommendation system is designed and implemented, and I can play a part in improving that system.
- The company processes make sense, and my managers are helpful. This is something that is cannot be taken for granted.


What are some downsides of working at Quora?
- You can get some sense of the challenges we face if you use our product. It is not easy to implement a solution that will immediately make great progress on our challenges, considering that Quora is a late-stage startup and many of the low-lying fruits are picked by very intelligent colleagues.


Do I get to choose to work for Quora from the US?
- Quora practices a [remote-first policy](https://quorablog.quora.com/Remote-First-at-Quora). All meetings should be remote by default, and the leadership team does not come to the site office. For Singapore citizens, I do still recommend asking to work from the Bay Area. The coordination time, which is the time where meetings are supposed to be held, will happen between 1 am to 7 am. For candidates who do not have straightforward access to a US work visa, I think Quora is keen to bring you to work from Canada where obtaining a work visa is more certain.
- All of my meetings are still virtual. As I live a bus ride away from the office, almost every day I travel to the office for lunch and takeaway dinner, and night snacks. This is saved me time to prepare my meals - there is no cheap and accessible food in the Bay Area like what you have in Singapore. I do have some interesting lunch conversations in the office, and none of them is from my immediate team.
