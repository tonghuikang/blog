How do you get along with your housemate?

- Points of contention - toilet seat, chores, quiet times, think of what annoys you off
- Splitwise and to what extent are we going to be calculative
- Cleanliness

The nature of the relationship - are we considered equals?
- Are rooms equal? Is the share of rent equal? Is risk-taking equal? Is effort equal?

What is a good question list for your prospective housemate?
