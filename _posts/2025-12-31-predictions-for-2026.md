title: Predictions for 2026
---
These are my predictions for 2026[^2025].

[^2025]: Please refer to my predictions for 2025 for reference (todo: cite).

There will continue to be more people working on AI models and products. There will continue to be more compute. There access to compute will be better. You will also have competent AI that helps you to improve AI.




## AI will write their own instructions

Models are not expected to complete its task. Models will think of ways to improve itself at doing similar tasks. Models will write their own instructions, and test their instructions.

Systems will scrutinize every interaction you have with AI. Either the task is perfectly done (explain what is meant by perfect).




## Context constraints will be invisible to users and developers

Currently . We have options to use 1 million length context.

Talk about OpenAI responses API.

Write a note that needle in a haystack problem is a fake task. The correct solution to the needle in a haystack problem is to use grep over context. We do not need frontier models to perform perfectly at the needle in the haystack problem.

Models should be able to do well even limited to 8k context. I do not think human context length is that long either.




## AI will be human-level at manipulating browsers

I think models try to keep the entire video history in context.

Multiple tabs. Multiple screenshots.

Claude Code tries to keep all the screenshots in context, and when Claude Code works on frontend tasks it frequently needs to execute context compaction.

Do you really remember what you saw one minute ago?

I would expect models to scan the model, make a quick note, drop the KV cache, and save the image to the filesystem. Training this is more complicated, because the prompt in the prompt completion pairs that you train on is more involved.

This unlocks many things. For example collating all the inf

There will still be an another line of work where agents not navigate the web through browsers, but through API calls.

Models will be very clear what is read and what is write.




## We will stop taking turns with AI

Currently I need to type to Claude Code. Ideally as I am typing models should already start starting. 

Cite multichannel models.

Include point on context compaction here.

I look forward to share my screen with Claude Code, and the model actually using what it sees on the screen.




## AI will be able polish your work

As I write this blogpost. Ideally it should just read my tweets, research the context and write a performative blogpost of me which I hope that I would have written. AI that match what you like and what you have produced[^prior-work].

[^prior-work]: Much of what we do is to remix what we have done in the past, and the exemplar work of other people.

The difference here is that models are . At least not in the exact style that you want. Models cannot replace Simon Willison yet. The input to Simon Willison is the Internet.



I expect video models to be able remix.

I think video models are already able to do this. I expect a full-length anime series where final output is . However, this does not mean video models are good at directing. I expect plot is to be written and key animation frames to be hand drawn. I expect Frienen vs Frienen to be hand directed.

For the Frienen vs Frienen fight (which anime episode cite Wikipedia). Given the Manga (which Manga chapter?), we will still prefer the professionally directed one over AI direction. However, models will be good enough, it would be indistinguiable.

For some more creative scenes (Oshi no Ko episode what, manga chapter what). The sequence is more abstract here. I have never done animation, I only see key frames posted on Twitter account which I assume is how anime is made.[^storytelling]

[^storytelling]: Storytelling is hard (cite director for Link Click, you need to cry yourself to tears). I do not think AI have good models for humans on what humans like. AI needs to be able to predict the comment section and improve the comment section. If you have prior work that has been published, the comment section is an important input to your work.
