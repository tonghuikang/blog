title: "How I Comment on Resumes"
categories: career
---

I have been commenting on technical resumes in Discord channels by the Tech Interview Handbook and cscareers.dev.
I want to compile a set of commonly given comments, so that I can copy and paste.
This also helps me retrieve how I have exactly written similar comments for clarity and thoughtfulness.
I also document some thoughts behind the comment as well.



# Formatting

If the design is ok, I would not force a template.
If there are multiple formatting errors, I would recommend using the template (i.e. Jake Resume Overleaf Template).

```
I see multiple <indentation> issues.
Would recommend use of Jake's Resume Overleaf Template (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).
```

I recommend resumes to take up one full page.
I will definitely make this recommendation if the candidate did not manage to fill up the second page, or the resume feels bloated.

```
I would suggest limiting your resume to one full page. (You can summarize/remove <sections>/<entries>)
```




```
Please fix the following formatting errors
- Inconsistent indentation
- Inconsistent alignment
- Inconsistent newline spacing
- Inconsistent date formats
- Inconsistent use of separators (e.g. between company and job title)
- Inconsistent chronological order
- Inconsistent font
- Inconsistent font size
- Inconsistent use of emphasis (underline, bold, italics, allcaps)
- Excessive use of emphasis
- Wrong use of capitalization for technical terminologies
- Incorrect usage of whitespace within the text (e.g. space before full stop)
- Large empty space
```



# Experience


Job titles should be understandable.
In the big tech companies, "senior", "staff", "manager" and "lead" means something.

```
Would prefer that you do not brand your previous role as "senior" or "lead" as they mean something specific in the industry you are applying to.
If "intern" is not an accurate description, you might want to consider "freelance developer" or "consultant" to describe your role.
Brand yourself accordingly if you want an internship or a new grad role.
```

Candidates should not dilute the message that they have solid industrial experience with other items.

```
Given that you have three strong internships, I suggest you move your teaching assistant / research assistant roles to a "Teaching and Research" section.
Consider having only industry work experience in the experience section. (Move <item> to the <project> section)
```

The reader wants to know a sequence of companies you worked at.
Having multiple appointment going on at the same time makes it difficult to infer.

```
Consider re-organizing your work experience so that you do not have more than one ongoing role.
```



# Bullet Point Writing

I prefer that candidates use the Google XYZ formula.

I think that STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method is bad for resumes.
It does not get to the point early, and it is not clear that each statement is utilized well.

```
Please use Google XYZ formula "Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z" (https://youtu.be/S_Macvy5CQE?t=83).

Please extrapolate this advice to other bullet points.
```

Do give praise if the Google XYZ formala is well applied.

```
Bullet points are well written, I can see the use of Google XYZ formula.
```


Some resumes like to mention the technology in front of what they accomplished.
I propose accomplishments provide a much better signal of your impact at work.
If they want to emphasize the technologies they employ, they can use the boldface.

```
Would prefer to that you state your accomplishments before your methods (e.g. prefer "Analyzed data with Python" over "Employed Python to analyze data").
Would prefer that you state your accomplishments before the context (e.g. prefer "Built the app with 5 people" over "Worked with 5 people to build the app")
```


If the bullet point is verbose (using more words that necessary), call that out.

```
Would prefer that you write more concisely. (e.g. "Developed and managed" over “Led feature development and project management”)
Please write in active language.
```


The candidate should not appear to be claim to be doing work that needs an entire team to do.

```
You might want pass the smell test.
I think you should specify how many people you worked with, or what exactly was your contribution.
```


The bullet point should be clear on exactly which feature or system are they working on.

```
It is not clear exactly which feature or system did you worked on. (e.g. What is <"solve and remediate privacy problems">?)
```

Bullet points should start with a power verb.
This gives an appearance of varied experience.

```
Please start each bullet point with a power verb
Would prefer that you vary your power verbs that starts your bullet point.
See https://www.faangtechleads.com/resume/general-guidelines for a list.
```


Bullet points should not end with one or two words. 
Fulling up the last line makes the resume looks fuller, and provide you a better use of space.

```
Would prefer that the last line of each bullet point to not end with only one or two words.
Try to fill up at least half of the line in the last line.
```


Bullet points should make sense to domain experts as well.
I only comment on Machine Learning because I am unfamiliar with frontend or backend technologies.

```
(e.g. "Improved model training time by 10%." - By doing what? What is the benefit?) 
```



# Language

If there is something is written not in a tactful manner, I think it is important to call it out.

```
You might want to review how this is written - <cite statement>
```

You want to make sure that your content is understood by an international audience.

```
You mentioned that your improvements saved Rs 6 per order. I would prefer you denote the amount in US dollars.
```
