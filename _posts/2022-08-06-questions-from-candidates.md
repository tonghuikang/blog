Usually, we reserve 5 minutes for interviewees to ask questions to the interviewer. Here are some common questions.

How is the remote culture like at Quora?
- I think it is as good as remote-first can bring.
- We have all-hands most of the weeks, which includes a Q&A where you can ask any questions. The question will definitely be addressed if it has a few upvotes.
- Admittedly, socially it is not very engaging to work remotely. I guess most engineers have their own family and social life.
- Regarding the office
    - Personally I go to the office every day to avoid preparing lunch.
    - Ever since I started going to the office after moving to Mountain View, I have never seen the CEO.
    - The engineer headcount is slightly more than a hundred, the average daily engineer attendance in the office is 10.
    - Half of the engineers who come to the office often graduated from college less than 3 years ago. We are also from different teams.


How is the work-life balance like at Quora?
- The co-ordination hours is officially 9pm to 3pm Pacific Time. Engineers are expected to be available for meetings during this period.
- Outside of this time, you are free to decide when to work.
- You are not expected to work overtime at night or during weekends. Sometimes it might be more convenient for me to deploy at night for easier code reversal.
- I would say that I work for 7 hours a day on average.
- After some time in the company, you are expected to do oncall rotations. I have not started my oncall rotations.
