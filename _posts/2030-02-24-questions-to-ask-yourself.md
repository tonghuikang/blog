Questions to ask yourself

# How do you respond?

We are all next token predictors.

We should be aware of our inputs and outputs.

Are you reinforcing your bad mistakes in the past


# How do you reason?

Wrong chain of thought, correct function call

Did you arrive at the correct answer with the wrong reasoning


# How do you evaluate what is good?

You don't get feedback for everything




# How do you learn?



# What do you value?

What are you naturally curious about

What do you find fun

What result are you happy with


# How do you lead?

How do you align what you want with what they want?

How do you run an organization

How would you hire

What characteristics do you want your employees to have

Given the very limited interactions

You do not have visibility on the work that they do
